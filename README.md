# Reservoir-River Coupling Multi-Objective Synergetic Scheduling (MOSO-RC)

This repository contains the code, data, and results for the paper:

**"Multi-objective synergetic scheduling of cascade reservoirs with reservoir–river coupling in sediment-laden rivers"**

## 🔍 Overview

This study addresses the issue of **water-sediment scheduling** for **multi-objective regulation** in sediment-laden rivers. Based on synergetics theory, a **multi-objective synergetic optimization model (MOSO-RC)** is established, incorporating the coupling relationship between **reservoirs and downstream river channels**. The model aims to balance:

- Power generation  
- Water supply  
- Ecological needs  
- Sediment regulation (desilting benefits)

### Key Features:
- A **reservoir–river coupling module** to coordinate sediment release and channel flushing.
- An **empirical sediment transport equation** for sediment movement estimation.
- A **sensitivity analysis** to evaluate subsystem interactions and robustness.
- Case study: **SMX** and **(XLD)** reservoirs on the **Yellow River**.
